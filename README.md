# Booking@UMU Platform

[🏠 THIS FILE](./README.md) &nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp; [🤝 CONTRIBUTIONS](./CONTRIBUTING.md) &nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp; [📋 TASKS](./TASKS.md)

A modular, multi-institution booking and allocation platform for **Uganda Martyrs University** and its affiliates — including on-campus hostels and Nkozi Hospital. It unifies academic resource booking, hostel allocation, and hospital services into a single **Laravel + React (Inertia)** application.

## Project Overview

The Booking@UMU Platform solves fragmented booking and allocation workflows across three core domains:

| Domain | Description |
|---|---|
| **Academic Booking** | Rooms, labs, equipment, and conference hall sessions |
| **Hostel Allocation** | Semester-based room/bed assignments and occupancy tracking |
| **Hospital Services** | Appointments, asynchronous consultations, and emergency escalation |

The goal is a maintainable, open-source codebase that can be extended by future student teams and integrated with UMU and Nkozi Hospital systems.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Laravel** (PHP 8+)
- **MySQL**
- **Inertia.js** (server-side adapter)

### Frontend
- **React** + Inertia.js (SPA-style pages inside Laravel)
- **Vite** (bundler)
- HTML/CSS (with optional CSS framework)

### Infrastructure / Dev
- Local LEMP stack (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP-FPM)
- Git + GitHub (feature-branch workflow with PR reviews)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:muliratendo/booking-app.git
cd booking-app/booking
```

### 2. Install Backend Dependencies

> Follow the internal docs or [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for prerequisites (Nginx, PHP-FPM, MySQL, Composer, etc.).

```bash
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Configure your `.env` for MySQL:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=umu_booking
DB_USERNAME=umu_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_password_here
```

Run migrations (and seeders when available):

```bash
php artisan migrate
# php artisan db:seed
```

### 3. Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

## Running the App

Start both servers in separate terminals:

**Terminal 1 — Laravel backend**
```bash
php artisan serve
```

**Terminal 2 — Vite dev server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit the URL printed by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`) or the Laravel dev URL (usually `http://127.0.0.1:8000`), depending on your setup.

---

## Branching and Workflow

We follow a **feature-branch + Pull Request** workflow on top of `main`.
>**Description**: Each change is developed in its own feature branch created from the main branch, then shared by pushing that branch and opening a pull request so teammates can review, discuss, and approve the changes before merging them back into main.
### Branch Rules

| Branch | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main` | Always deployable. Updated via Pull Requests only. |
| `feature/<area>-<short-desc>` | New features |
| `bugfix/<area>-<short-desc>` | Bug fixes |
| `docs/<short-desc>` | Documentation updates |

### Branch Examples
- `feature/academic-booking-list`
- `feature/hospital-emergency-flow`
- `bugfix/hostel-allocation-off-by-one`
- `docs/update-api-section`

### Basic Flow

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/academic-booking-list

# make your changes, then commit
git add .
git commit -m "Implement academic booking list page"

git push -u origin feature/academic-booking-list
```

Then open a **Pull Request** into `main` on GitHub, request a review, and merge only after approval.
